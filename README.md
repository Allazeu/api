# api
APIs that I have created can be found here. This is not limited to one language and can vary by folder.

All of these files can be used by anyone as long as the proper credits are given.
All have the right to modify and redistribute any of these files commercially or not. Althought I personally do not expect any of them to be used to such a great extent.

All of these files have been created from the ground-up unless otherwise noted.
Please check out the wiki for documentation and usage of these APIs.

Thank you - Centurian.
